# CMPG NPG-005 Messaging Appplication

> This is the messaging app of the group project that should include functionality of the following:
1. Should be able to message a single person.
2. Should be able to message a group of people.
3. Internet connectivity, since a LAN will not be available.


> How to test the application:
1. Run ServerMain.java. This starts the server for clients to connect to.
2. Run Main.java. This creates a client to connect to the server. The server accepts the connection and allows for users to message the server.
3. Once a user has connected to the server, it allows for the client to choose a username. 
4. After this, the user is able to send messages to the server. Current functionality does not include for a client to receive messages though this will be added in the future.
